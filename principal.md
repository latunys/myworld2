### 1. Business Principles

   **Principle 1: Primacy of Principles**
   
   Statement:
   - These principles of information management apply to all organizations within the enterprise.
   
   Rationale:
   - The only way we can provide a consistent and measurable level of quality information to decision-makers is if all organizations abide by the principles.
   
   Implications:
   - Without this principle, exclusions, favoritism, and inconsistency would rapidly undermine the management of information.
   - Information management initiatives will not begin until they are examined for compliance with the principles.
   - A conflict with a principle will be resolved by changing the framework of the initiative.

   
   **Principle 2: Maximize  Benefit to the Enterprise**
   
   Statement:
   - Information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit to the enterprise as a whole.
   
   Rationale:
   - This principle embodies "service above self". Decisions made from an enterprise-wide perspective have greater long-term value than decisions made from any particular organizational perspective. Maximum return on investment requires information management decisions to adhere to enterprise-wide drivers and priorities. No minority group will detract from the benefit of the whole. However, this principle will not preclude any minority group from getting its job done.
   
   Implications:
   - Achieving maximum enterprise-wide benefit will require changes in the way we plan and manage information - technology alone will not bring about this change
   - Some organizations may have to concede their own preferences for the greater benefit of the entire enterprise
   - Application development priorities must be established by the entire enterprise for the entire enterprise
   - Applications components should be shared across organizational boundaries
   - Information management initiatives should be conducted in accordance with the enterprise plan 
   
   Individual organizations should pursue information management initiatives which conform to the blueprints and priorities established by the enterprise. The plan will be changed as needed.
   
   - As needs arise, priorities must be adjusted; a forum with comprehensive enterprise representation should make these decisions
   
   **Principle 3: Information Management is Everybody's Business**
   
   Statement:
   - All organizations in the enterprise participate in information management decisions needed to accomplish business objectives.
   
   Rationale:
   - Information users are the key stakeholders, or customers, in the application of technology to address a business need. In order to ensure information management is aligned with the business, all organizations in the enterprise must be involved in all aspects of the information environment. The business experts from across the enterprise and the technical staff responsible for developing and sustaining the information environment need to come together as a team to jointly define the goals and objectives of IT.
   
   Implications:
   - To operate as a team, every stakeholder, or customer, will need to accept responsibility for developing the information environment.
   - Commitment of resources will be required to implement this principle.
   
   **Principle 4: Business Continuity**
   
   Statement:
   - Enterprise operations are maintained in spite of system interruptions.
   
   Rationale:
   - As system operations become more pervasive, we become more dependent on them; therefore, we must consider the reliability of such systems throughout their design and use. Business premises throughout the enterprise must be provided with the capability to continue their business functions regardless of external events. Hardware failure, natural disasters, and data corruption should not be allowed to disrupt or stop enterprise activities. The enterprise business functions must be capable of operating on alternative information delivery mechanisms.
   
   Implications:
   - Dependency on shared system applications mandates that the risks of business interruption must be established in advance and managed.
  
  Management includes but is not limited to periodic reviews, testing for vulnerability and exposure, or designing mission-critical services to ensure business function continuity through redundant or alternative capabilities.
  
   - Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability should be addressed at the time of design.
   - Applications must be assessed for criticality and impact on the enterprise mission, in order to determine what level of continuity is required and what corresponding recovery plan is necessary.
   
   **Principle 5: Common Use Applications**
   
   Statement:
    - Development of applications used across the enterprise is preferred over the development of similar or duplicative applications which are only provided to a particular organization.
    
   Rationale:
    - Duplicative capability is expensive and proliferates conflicting data.
    
   Implications:
    - Organizations which depend on a capability which does not serve the entire enterprise must change over to the replacement enterprise-wide capability; this will require establishment of and adherence to a policy requiring this
    - Organizations will not be allowed to develop capabilities for their own use which are similar/duplicative of enterprise-wide capabilities; in this way, expenditures of scarce resources to develop essentially the same capability in marginally different ways will be reduced
    - Data and information used to support enterprise decision-making will be standardized to a much greater extent than previously

   This is because the smaller, organizational capabilities which produced different data (which was not shared among other organizations) will be replaced by enterprise-wide capabilities. The impetus for adding to the set of enterprise-wide capabilities may well come from an organization making a convincing case for the value of the data/information previously produced by its organizational capability, but the resulting capability will become part of the enterprise-wide system, and the data it produces will be shared across the enterprise.

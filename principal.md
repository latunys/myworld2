### 1. Business Principles

   **Principle 1: Primacy of Principles**
   
   Statement:
   - These principles of information management apply to all organizations within the enterprise.
   
   Rationale:
   - The only way we can provide a consistent and measurable level of quality information to decision-makers is if all organizations abide by the principles.
   
   Implications:
   - Without this principle, exclusions, favoritism, and inconsistency would rapidly undermine the management of information.
   - Information management initiatives will not begin until they are examined for compliance with the principles.
   - A conflict with a principle will be resolved by changing the framework of the initiative.

   
   **Principle 2: Maximize  Benefit to the Enterprise**
   
   Statement:
   - Information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit to the enterprise as a whole.
   
   Rationale:
   - This principle embodies "service above self". Decisions made from an enterprise-wide perspective have greater long-term value than decisions made from any particular organizational perspective. Maximum return on investment requires information management decisions to adhere to enterprise-wide drivers and priorities. No minority group will detract from the benefit of the whole. However, this principle will not preclude any minority group from getting its job done.
   
   Implications:
   - Achieving maximum enterprise-wide benefit will require changes in the way we plan and manage information - technology alone will not bring about this change
   - Some organizations may have to concede their own preferences for the greater benefit of the entire enterprise
   - Application development priorities must be established by the entire enterprise for the entire enterprise
   - Applications components should be shared across organizational boundaries
   - Information management initiatives should be conducted in accordance with the enterprise plan 
   
   Individual organizations should pursue information management initiatives which conform to the blueprints and priorities established by the enterprise. The plan will be changed as needed.
   
   - As needs arise, priorities must be adjusted; a forum with comprehensive enterprise representation should make these decisions

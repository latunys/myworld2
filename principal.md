## [Architecture Principles](pre.html)

### 1. Business Principles

   **Principle 1: Primacy of Principles**
   
   Statement:
   - These principles of information management apply to all organizations within the enterprise.
   
   Rationale:
   - The only way we can provide a consistent and measurable level of quality information to decision-makers is if all organizations abide by the principles.
   
   Implications:
   - Without this principle, exclusions, favoritism, and inconsistency would rapidly undermine the management of information.
   - Information management initiatives will not begin until they are examined for compliance with the principles.
   - A conflict with a principle will be resolved by changing the framework of the initiative.

   
   **Principle 2: Maximize  Benefit to the Enterprise**
   
   Statement:
   - Information management decisions are made to provide maximum benefit to the enterprise as a whole.
   
   Rationale:
   - This principle embodies "service above self". Decisions made from an enterprise-wide perspective have greater long-term value than decisions made from any particular organizational perspective. Maximum return on investment requires information management decisions to adhere to enterprise-wide drivers and priorities. No minority group will detract from the benefit of the whole. However, this principle will not preclude any minority group from getting its job done.
   
   Implications:
   - Achieving maximum enterprise-wide benefit will require changes in the way we plan and manage information - technology alone will not bring about this change
   - Some organizations may have to concede their own preferences for the greater benefit of the entire enterprise
   - Application development priorities must be established by the entire enterprise for the entire enterprise
   - Applications components should be shared across organizational boundaries
   - Information management initiatives should be conducted in accordance with the enterprise plan 
   
   Individual organizations should pursue information management initiatives which conform to the blueprints and priorities established by the enterprise. The plan will be changed as needed.
   
   - As needs arise, priorities must be adjusted; a forum with comprehensive enterprise representation should make these decisions
   
   **Principle 3: Information Management is Everybody's Business**
   
   Statement:
   - All organizations in the enterprise participate in information management decisions needed to accomplish business objectives.
   
   Rationale:
   - Information users are the key stakeholders, or customers, in the application of technology to address a business need. In order to ensure information management is aligned with the business, all organizations in the enterprise must be involved in all aspects of the information environment. The business experts from across the enterprise and the technical staff responsible for developing and sustaining the information environment need to come together as a team to jointly define the goals and objectives of IT.
   
   Implications:
   - To operate as a team, every stakeholder, or customer, will need to accept responsibility for developing the information environment.
   - Commitment of resources will be required to implement this principle.
   
   **Principle 4: Business Continuity**
   
   Statement:
   - Enterprise operations are maintained in spite of system interruptions.
   
   Rationale:
   - As system operations become more pervasive, we become more dependent on them; therefore, we must consider the reliability of such systems throughout their design and use. Business premises throughout the enterprise must be provided with the capability to continue their business functions regardless of external events. Hardware failure, natural disasters, and data corruption should not be allowed to disrupt or stop enterprise activities. The enterprise business functions must be capable of operating on alternative information delivery mechanisms.
   
   Implications:
   - Dependency on shared system applications mandates that the risks of business interruption must be established in advance and managed.
  
  Management includes but is not limited to periodic reviews, testing for vulnerability and exposure, or designing mission-critical services to ensure business function continuity through redundant or alternative capabilities.
  
   - Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability should be addressed at the time of design.
   - Applications must be assessed for criticality and impact on the enterprise mission, in order to determine what level of continuity is required and what corresponding recovery plan is necessary.
   
   **Principle 5: Common Use Applications**
   
   Statement:
    - Development of applications used across the enterprise is preferred over the development of similar or duplicative applications which are only provided to a particular organization.
    
   Rationale:
    - Duplicative capability is expensive and proliferates conflicting data.
    
   Implications:
    - Organizations which depend on a capability which does not serve the entire enterprise must change over to the replacement enterprise-wide capability; this will require establishment of and adherence to a policy requiring this
    - Organizations will not be allowed to develop capabilities for their own use which are similar/duplicative of enterprise-wide capabilities; in this way, expenditures of scarce resources to develop essentially the same capability in marginally different ways will be reduced
    - Data and information used to support enterprise decision-making will be standardized to a much greater extent than previously

   This is because the smaller, organizational capabilities which produced different data (which was not shared among other organizations) will be replaced by enterprise-wide capabilities. The impetus for adding to the set of enterprise-wide capabilities may well come from an organization making a convincing case for the value of the data/information previously produced by its organizational capability, but the resulting capability will become part of the enterprise-wide system, and the data it produces will be shared across the enterprise.
   
   **Principle 6: Service Orientation**
   
   Statement:
   - The architecture is based on a design of services which mirror real-world business activities comprising the enterprise (or inter-enterprise) business processes.
   
   Rationale:
   - Service orientation delivers enterprise agility and Boundaryless Information Flow.
   
   Implications:
   - Service representation utilizes business descriptions to provide context (i.e., business process, goal, rule, policy, service interface, and service component) and implements services using service orchestration
   - Service orientation places unique requirements on the infrastructure, and implementations should use open standards to realize interoperability and location transparency
   - Implementations are environment-specific; they are constrained or enabled by context and must be described within that context
   - Strong governance of service representation and implementation is required
   - A "Litmus Test", which determines a "good service", is required
   
   **7. Compliance with Law**
   
   Statement:
   - Enterprise information management processes comply with all relevant laws, policies, and regulations.
   
   Rationale:
   - Enterprise policy is to abide by laws, policies, and regulations. This will not preclude business process improvements that lead to changes in policies and regulations.
   
   Implications:
      - The enterprise must be mindful to comply with laws, regulations, and external policies regarding the collection, retention, and management of data
      - Education and access to the rules 
      
   Efficiency, need, and common sense are not the only drivers. Changes in the law and changes in regulations may drive changes in our processes or applications.
   
   **8. IT Responsibility**
   
   Statement:
   - The IT organization is responsible for owning and implementing IT processes and infrastructure that enable solutions to meet user-defined requirements for functionality, service levels, cost, and delivery timing.

   Rationale:
   - Effectively align expectations with capabilities and costs so that all projects are cost-effective. Efficient and effective solutions have reasonable costs and clear benefits.
   
   Implications:
   - A process must be created to prioritize projects
   - The IT function must define processes to manage business unit expectations
   - Data, application, and technology models must be created to enable integrated quality solutions and to maximize results
   
   **9. Protection of Intellectual Property**
   
   Statement:
   - The enterprise's Intellectual Property (IP) must be protected. This protection must be reflected in the IT architecture, implementation, and governance processes.
   
   Rationale:
   - A major part of an enterprise's IP is hosted in the IT domain.
   
   Implications:
   - While protection of IP assets is everybody's business, much of the actual protection is implemented in the IT domain - even trust in non-IT processes can be managed by IT processes (email, mandatory notes, etc.)
   - A security policy, governing human and IT actors, will be required that can substantially improve protection of IP; this must be capable of both avoiding compromises and reducing liabilities
   - Resources on such policies can be found at the SANS Institute (refer to www.sans.org/security-resources/policies)

### 2. Data Principles

  **Principle 10: Data is an Asset**
  
  Statement:
  - Data is an asset that has value to the enterprise and is managed accordingly.
  
  Rationale:
  - Data is a valuable corporate resource; it has real, measurable value. In simple terms, the purpose of data is to aid decision-making. Accurate, timely data is critical to accurate, timely decisions. Most corporate assets are carefully managed, and data is no exception. Data is the foundation of our decision-making, so we must also carefully manage data to ensure that we know where it is, can rely upon its accuracy, and can obtain it when and where we need it.
  
  Implications:
  - This is one of three closely-related principles regarding data: data is an asset; data is shared; and data is easily accessible 
              The implication is that there is an education task to ensure that all organizations within the enterprise understand the relationship between value of        data, sharing of data, and accessibility to data.
  - Stewards must have the authority and means to manage the data for which they are accountable
  - We must make the cultural transition from "data ownership" thinking to "data stewardship" thinking
  - The role of data steward is critical because obsolete, incorrect, or inconsistent data could be passed to enterprise personnel and adversely affect decisions across the enterprise
  - Part of the role of data steward, who manages the data, is to ensure data quality 
              
   Procedures must be developed and used to prevent and correct errors in the information and to improve those processes that produce flawed information. Data quality will need to be measured and steps taken to improve data quality - it is probable that policy and procedures will need to be developed for this as well.
   
   - A forum with comprehensive enterprise-wide representation should decide on process changes suggested by the steward
   - Since data is an asset of value to the entire enterprise, data stewards accountable for properly managing the data must be assigned at the enterprise level
   
   **Principle 11: Data is Shared**
   
   Statement:
   - Users have access to the data necessary to perform their duties; therefore, data is shared across enterprise functions and organizations.
   
   Rationale:
   - Timely access to accurate data is essential to improving the quality and efficiency of enterprise decision-making. It is less costly to maintain timely, accurate data in a single application, and then share it, than it is to maintain duplicative data in multiple applications. The enterprise holds a wealth of data, but it is stored in hundreds of incompatible stovepipe databases. The speed of data collection, creation, transfer, and assimilation is driven by the ability of the organization to efficiently share these islands of data across the organization.

Shared data will result in improved decisions since we will rely on fewer (ultimately one virtual) sources of more accurate and timely managed data for all of our decision-making. Electronically shared data will result in increased efficiency when existing data entities can be used, without re-keying, to create new entities.
   
   Implications:
   - This is one of three closely-related principles regarding data: data is an asset; data is shared; and data is easily accessible
                The implication is that there is an education task to ensure that all organizations within the enterprise understand the relationship between value of data, sharing of data, and accessibility to data.
   - To enable data sharing we must develop and abide by a common set of policies, procedures, and standards governing data management and access for both the short and the long term
   - For the short term, to preserve our significant investment in legacy systems, we must invest in software capable of migrating legacy system data into a shared data environment
   - We will also need to develop standard data models, data elements, and other metadata that defines this shared environment and develop a repository system for storing this metadata to make it accessible
   - For the long term, as legacy systems are replaced, we must adopt and enforce common data access policies and guidelines for new application developers to ensure that data in new applications remains available to the shared environment and that data in the shared environment can continue to be used by the new applications
   - For both the short term and the long term we must adopt common methods and tools for creating, maintaining, and accessing the data shared across the enterprise
   - Data sharing will require a significant cultural change
   - This principle of data sharing will continually "bump up against" the principle of data security - under no circumstances will the data sharing principle cause confidential data to be compromised
   - Data made available for sharing will have to be relied upon by all users to execute their respective tasks 
                
   This will ensure that only the most accurate and timely data is relied upon for decision-making. Shared data will become the enterprise-wide "virtual single source" of data.
       
   **Principle 12: Data is Accessible**
   
   Statement:
   - Data is accessible for users to perform their functions.
   
   Rationale:
   - Wide access to data leads to efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making, and affords a timely response to information requests and service delivery. Using information must be considered from an enterprise perspective to allow access by a wide variety of users. Staff time is saved and consistency of data is improved.
   
   Implications:
   - This is one of three closely-related principles regarding data: data is an asset; data is shared; and data is easily accessible 
                 The implication is that there is an education task to ensure that all organizations within the enterprise understand the relationship between value of data, sharing of data, and accessibility to data.
   - Accessibility involves the ease with which users obtain information
   - The way information is accessed and displayed must be sufficiently adaptable to meet a wide range of enterprise users and their corresponding methods of access
   - Access to data does not constitute understanding of the data - personnel should take caution not to misinterpret information
   - Access to data does not necessarily grant the user access rights to modify or disclose the data 
                 
   This will require an education process and a change in the organizational culture, which currently supports a belief in "ownership" of data by functional units.
   
   **Principle 13: Data Trustee**
   
   Statement:
   - Each data element has a trustee accountable for data quality.
   
   Rationale:
   - One of the benefits of an architected environment is the ability to share data (e.g., text, video, sound, etc.) across the enterprise. As the degree of data sharing grows and business units rely upon common information, it becomes essential that only the data trustee makes decisions about the content of data. Since data can lose its integrity when it is entered multiple times, the data trustee will have sole responsibility for data entry which eliminates redundant human effort and data storage resources.
   
Note:
    A trustee is different than a steward - a trustee is responsible for accuracy and currency of the data, while responsibilities of a steward may be broader and include data standardization and definition tasks. 
    
   Implications:
   - Real trusteeship dissolves the data "ownership" issues and allows the data to be available to meet all users' needs
                 This implies that a cultural change from data "ownership" to data "trusteeship" may be required.
   - The data trustee will be responsible for meeting quality requirements levied upon the data for which the trustee is accountable
   - It is essential that the trustee has the ability to provide user confidence in the data based upon attributes such as "data source"
   - It is essential to identify the true source of the data in order that the data authority can be assigned this trustee responsibility 
                 
   This does not mean that classified sources will be revealed nor does it mean the source will be the trustee.
                 
   - Information should be captured electronically once and immediately validated as close to the source as possible 
   Quality control measures must be implemented to ensure the integrity of the data.
   - As a result of sharing data across the enterprise, the trustee is accountable and responsible for the accuracy and currency of their designated data element(s) and, subsequently, must then recognize the importance of this trusteeship responsibility
   
   **Principle 14: Common Vocabulary and Data Definitions**
   
   Statement:
   - Data is defined consistently throughout the enterprise, and the definitions are understandable and available to all users.
   
   Rationale:
   - The data that will be used in the development of applications must have a common definition throughout the Headquarters to enable sharing of data. A common vocabulary will facilitate communications and enable dialog to be effective. In addition, it is required to interface systems and exchange data.
   
   Implications:
   - We are lulled into thinking that this issue is adequately addressed because there are people with "data administration" job titles and forums with charters implying responsibility 
                Significant additional energy and resources must be committed to this task. It is key to the success of efforts to improve the information environment. This is separate from but related to the issue of data element definition, which is addressed by a broad community - this is more like a common vocabulary and definition.
   - The enterprise must establish the initial common vocabulary for the business; the definitions will be used uniformly throughout the enterprise
   - Whenever a new data definition is required, the definition effort will be co-ordinated and reconciled with the corporate "glossary" of data descriptions 
                The enterprise data administrator will provide this co-ordination.
                
   - Ambiguities resulting from multiple parochial definitions of data must give way to accepted enterprise-wide definitions and understanding
   - Multiple data standardization initiatives need to be co-ordinated
   - Functional data administration responsibilities must be assigned

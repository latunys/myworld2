   - Architecture capability
   - Partnership and contract agreements

**3. Architectural**

- Organizational Model for Enterprise Architecture 
- Existing Architecture Framework, including: 
  - Architecture method
  - Architecture content
  - Configured and deployed tools
  - Architecture Principles
  - Architecture Repository

### Steps

**1. Scope the Enterprise Organizations Impacted**

   - Identify core enterprise (units) - those who are most affected and achieve most value from the work
   - Identify soft enterprise (units) - those who will see change to their capability and work with core units but are otherwise not directly affected
   - Identify extended enterprise (units) - those units outside the scoped enterprise who will be affected in their own Enterprise Architecture
   - Identify communities involved (enterprises) - those stakeholders who will be affected and who are in groups of communities
   - Identify governance involved, including legal frameworks and geographies (enterprises)
   
**2. Confirm Governance and Support Frameworks**

   The architecture framework will form the keystone to the flavor (centralized or federated, light or heavy, etc.) of Architecture Governance organization and guidelines that need to be developed. Part of the major output of this phase is a framework for Architecture Governance. We need to understand how architectural material (standards, guidelines, models, compliance reports, etc.) is brought under governance; i.e., what type of governance repository characteristics are going to be required, what relationships and status recording are necessary to ascertain which governance process (dispensation, compliance, take-on, retirement, etc.) has ownership of an architectural artifact.

It is likely that the existing governance and support models of an organization will need to change to support the newly adopted architecture framework.

To manage the organizational change required to adopt the new architectural framework, the current enterprise governance and support models will need to be assessed to understand their overall shape and content. Additionally, the sponsors and stakeholders for architecture will need to be consulted on potential impacts that could occur.

Upon completion of this step, the architecture touch-points and likely impacts should be understood and agreed by relevant stakeholders.

**3. Define and Establish Enterprise Architecture Team and Organization**

   - Determine existing enterprise and business capability
   - Conduct an Enterprise Architecture/business change maturity assessment, if required
   - Identify gaps in existing work areas
   - Allocate key roles and responsibilities for Enterprise Architecture Capability management and governance
   - Define requests for change to existing business programs and projects: 
     - Inform existing Enterprise Architecture and IT architecture work of stakeholder requirements
     - Request assessment of impact on their plans and work
     - Identify common areas of interest
     - Identify any critical differences and conflicts of interest
     - Produce requests for change to stakeholder activities
   - Determine constraints on Enterprise Architecture work
   - Review and agree with sponsors and board
   - Assess budget requirements
   
**4. Identify and Establish Architecture Principles**

**5. Tailor the TOGAF Framework**

  In this step, determine what tailoring of the TOGAF framework is required. Consider the need for:
  
  - **Terminology Tailoring:** architecture practitioners should use terminology that is generally understood across the enterprise 
     Tailoring should produce an agreed terminology set for description of architectural content. Consideration should be given to the creation of an Enterprise Glossary, to be updated throughout the architecture process.
    
  - **Process Tailoring:** the TOGAF ADM provides a generic process for carrying out architecture 
    Process tailoring provides the opportunity to remove tasks that are already carried out elsewhere in the organization, add organization-specific tasks (such as specific checkpoints), and to align the ADM processes to external process frameworks and touch-points. Key touch-points to be addressed would include:
    - Links to (project and service) portfolio management processes
    - Links to project lifecycle
    - Links to operations handover processes
    - Links to operational management processes (including configuration management, change management, and service management)
    - Links to procurement processes
    
  - **Content Tailoring:** using the TOGAF Architecture Content Framework and Enterprise Continuum as a basis, tailoring of content structure and classification approach allows adoption of third-party content frameworks and also allows for customization of the framework to support organization-specific requirements
